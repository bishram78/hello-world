# hello-world

Hi,
This is Bishram Munda. The code loving boy.
Actually I graduated in physics from Kolhan University, but I have a hobby called worm of programming. Therefore, I am here and started GitHub to see how it works.
This the project of hello world. Everyone needs to write this code before diving into the program world.
